          <h4>Tit-tit is a meal planing app, developed by <a href="https://github.com/hymced">CÃ©dric ROCHER</a> and <a href="https://github.com/linhvnde">Linh NGUYEN HOANG</a> </h4>
          We created this app to wish for our people to stay healthy with delicious recipes. The <span>Tit-tit Kitchen</span> is named after a combination of French word Bon-appetit and Vietnamese way of saying Bon-appetit it a sweet and short. Just like our app, we want to keep it sweet and short.
